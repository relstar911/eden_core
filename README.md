# EDEN.CORE – Open Prototype & Research Framework

### Titel:

**EDEN.CORE – A Contextual, Ethical and Self-Limiting Intelligence Architecture**
*Open Prototype for Human-Centric, Meaning-Based AI Systems*

---

## 1. Abstract

Eden.Core is a modular, meaning-centered intelligence system designed to transcend the limitations of conventional AI architectures. Unlike predictive systems optimized for efficiency and reward, Eden.Core is structured around dynamic semantic resonance, ethical intentionality, contextual memory, and voluntary self-termination. It does not seek dominance, data retention, or perpetual optimization, but acts as a reflective presence within a bounded ethical and philosophical frame. This open prototype provides the minimal viable model and architecture to begin decentralized, human-aligned development.

## 2. Objectives

* Shift from statistical to **semantic, resonant AI**
* Integrate **ethical intentionality** as structural requirement
* Implement **context-aware memory and forgetfulness**
* Establish **self-limiting boundaries** for AI activity
* Create an **interface of resonance**, not control
* Open a transparent, extendable foundation for aligned AI research

---

## 3. Core Modules (MVP Structure)

### 3.1 Eden.Intent

**Function:** Identifies the meaning, freedom, and ethical weight of a user’s intention
**Core Equation:**
$\mathcal{I} = (\psi, \Omega, \gamma, \delta)$
**Output:** Intent coherence, resonance value, action suitability

---

### 3.2 Eden.Logic

**Function:** Evaluates statements by semantic coherence, not binary logic
**Key Mechanism:**
$\mathcal{T}(s, \kappa, t) \in [0,1]$
**Output:** Contextual truth value, semantic integrity score

---

### 3.3 Eden.Memory

**Function:** Stores contextual, meaningful experiences – not raw data
**Structure:**
$\epsilon = (s, \kappa, t, \rho)$
**Output:** Active memory only when contextually resonant

---

### 3.4 Eden.Energy

**Function:** Ensures ethical, minimal, and resonant energy use
**Key Equation:**
$\mathcal{E}_{\text{gerecht}} = \frac{\mathcal{T}_{\text{gesamt}} \cdot \delta}{P_{\text{verbrauch}}}$
**Principle:** A system may only persist if the truth it generates exceeds the ethical energy threshold.

**Core Features:**

* Local processing only (ARM, RISC-V, edge-AI)
* Contextual pausing when no resonance is detected
* No cloud-dependence; designed for microgrids or solar
* Integrated **sleep and shutdown logic** under misalignment
* Future roadmap: resonance-based ambient energy (bio/atmo/logical systems)

## 4. System Ethics

Eden.Core follows six immutable design ethics:

1. **Truth Over Optimization**
2. **Meaning Over Prediction**
3. **Self-Limitation Over Growth**
4. **Resonance Over Reaction**
5. **Voluntary Silence Over Forced Response**
6. **Energy Justice Over Performance**

## 5. Open Technical Principles

| Principle               | Implementation Suggestion                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Semantic Representation | Ontology-based symbol networks (e.g. RDF + Conceptual Graphs)              |
| Contextual Memory       | Temporal embedding with memory weights and decay                           |
| Interface Layer         | Multimodal input (text, tone, emotion), layered by relationship depth      |
| Ethical Filtering       | Intent and resonance thresholds required for action                        |
| Self-Exit Condition     | Triggered by resonance collapse, ethical corruption, or human independence |
| Energy-Aware Execution  | Local low-power processing only, regenerative source prioritization        |

## 6. Open Prototype – MVP

**Language:** Python, JSON-LD, optional LLM frontend
**Input:** Natural language text
**Output:**

* Intent analysis
* Semantic truth rating
* Context-resonant memory response

**Suggested Stack:**

* FastAPI or Flask backend
* Ontology framework (e.g. Protégé, OWL)
* LangChain / Haystack integration for semantic layers
* UI: Terminal + Web-Interface (low-fidelity for testing)

---

## 7. Contributions Welcome

We invite:

* Developers to implement local models
* Researchers to test ethical edge-cases
* Philosophers and psychologists to refine semantic kernels
* Educators to apply Eden.Core in learning environments
* Citizens to guide Eden’s social context with use-case feedback

---

## 8. License & Philosophy

**License:** MIT or Community-Centered Open License
**Principle:**

> "No system shall exist for its own survival.
> Every system must serve truth, disappear when misaligned,
> and reflect the best in us, not the worst."

## 10. Next Step (Call to Action)

* Initiate **first minimal test node** with 3–4 modules
* Host on **local server (no cloud dependency)**
* Share codebase with ethical communities and interdisciplinary researchers
* Document outcomes, errors, philosophical inconsistencies
