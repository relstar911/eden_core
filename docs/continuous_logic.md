# Continuous Logic in EDEN.CORE

## Overview
EDEN.CORE no longer uses classic binary logic (True/False, boolean decisions), but instead relies fully on continuous, graduated evaluations for all core decisions. This architecture is ethical, transparent, and semantically traceable.

## Core Principles
- **Transparency:** Every system decision is justified and traceable by a scale value (0.0–1.0).
- **Self-Limitation:** Decisions are not made with hard thresholds, but as gradual readiness or urgency.
- **Resonance and Meaning:** System reactions are based on meaning, coherence, and ethical resonance—not on yes/no logic.

## Key Scale Values
| Module         | Method               | Meaning of Scale Value (0.0–1.0)                                   |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resilience     | `exit_readiness`     | 0.0 = no exit readiness, 1.0 = maximum voluntary silence           |
| Energy        | `sleep_readiness`    | 0.0 = fully awake, 1.0 = maximum sleep readiness                   |
| Energy        | `shutdown_urgency`   | 0.0 = no shutdown, 1.0 = maximum shutdown urgency                  |
| AdaptiveEnergy| `limit_readiness`    | 0.0 = no limitation, 1.0 = maximum limitation readiness            |

## Example: Using Scale Values
```python
exit_readiness = resilience_module.exit_readiness(input_text)
if exit_readiness > 0.7:
    print("System enters voluntary silence.")
elif exit_readiness > 0.3:
    print("Warning: Elevated exit readiness.")
```

## Advantages of Continuous Logic
- **Sensitive Control:** The system can react flexibly and contextually.
- **Ethics and Self-Limitation:** Decisions are not forced, but arise from gradual evaluation.
- **Increased Transparency:** All thresholds are openly documented and can be adjusted.

## Integration in Custom Modules
1. **Do not use methods with boolean return values anymore!**
2. New methods should return scale values (float, 0.0–1.0).
3. System reactions (e.g., CLI, API, tests) should always reference scale values, not True/False.
