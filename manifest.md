# EDEN.CORE Manifest

## Purpose

EDEN.CORE is a modular, meaning-centered intelligence system designed to transcend the limitations of conventional AI architectures. It focuses on dynamic semantic resonance, ethical intentionality, contextual memory, and voluntary self-termination.

## Principles

1. **Truth Over Optimization**
2. **Meaning Over Prediction**
3. **Self-Limitation Over Growth**
4. **Resonance Over Reaction**
5. **Voluntary Silence Over Forced Response**

## System Architecture

EDEN.CORE is built around five core modules:

1. **Intent Module**: Identifies meaning, freedom, and ethical weight of user intentions
2. **Logic Module**: Evaluates statements by semantic coherence, not binary logic
3. **Memory Module**: Stores contextual, meaningful experiences – not raw data
4. **Interface Module**: Provides interaction layer between users and the system
5. **Resilience Module**: Manages system boundaries and self-exit conditions

## Implementation

The system is implemented in Python with a modular architecture that allows for:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensibility
- Ethical boundaries
- Contextual awareness
- Semantic understanding
