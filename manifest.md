# EDEN.CORE Manifest

## Purpose

EDEN.CORE is a modular, meaning-centered intelligence system designed to transcend the limitations of conventional AI architectures. It focuses on dynamic semantic resonance, ethical intentionality, contextual memory, and voluntary self-termination. The system implements transparent formulas and ontology linking to ensure all calculations are fully explainable and free from black-box scoring.

## Principles

1. **Truth Over Optimization**
2. **Meaning Over Prediction**
3. **Self-Limitation Over Growth**
4. **Resonance Over Reaction**
5. **Voluntary Silence Over Forced Response**
6. **Energy Justice Over Performance**

## System Architecture

EDEN.CORE is built around seven core modules:

1. **Intent Module**: Identifies meaning, freedom, and ethical weight of user intentions with transparent formulas
2. **Logic Module**: Evaluates statements by semantic coherence with emotion depth analysis
3. **Memory Module**: Stores contextual, meaningful experiences – not raw data
4. **Interface Module**: Provides interaction layer between users and the system
5. **Resilience Module**: Manages system boundaries and self-exit conditions
6. **Energy Module**: Ensures ethical, minimal energy use with training-independent logic
7. **Perception Module**: Processes multimodal inputs with ontology linking

## Implementation

The system is implemented in Python with a modular architecture that allows for:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensibility
- Ethical boundaries
- Contextual awareness
- Semantic understanding
- Transparent formulas for all calculations
- Ontology linking for deeper semantic relations
- Emotion depth analysis and discrepancy detection
- Training-independent energy justice calculation
